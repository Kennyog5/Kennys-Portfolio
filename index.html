                <h5> SOCIAL MEDIA MANAGER, WEB DEVELOPER <span>PROJECT MANAGER & PRODUCT MANAGER</span></h5>
                    <p>I’m a Social Media Manager, Project Manager, Web Developer, and Product Manager with over two years of experience working with indie authors. I mainly manage TikTok accounts, helping authors promote their books, reach new readers, and build a strong online presence.

Over the years, I’ve worked with many authors across different genres, handling content planning, trend research, posting, and engagement on TikTok. I understand how the platform works and how to use it to create consistent visibility for books and author brands.

Alongside social media, I manage projects from start to finish, making sure timelines, tasks, and goals stay on track. My background in web development and product management helps me support digital projects with both strategy and practical execution.

I’m organized, reliable, and easy to work with, and I enjoy helping authors and creatives focus on their work while I take care of the planning, systems, and day-to-day management.</p>
